          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order
            Lagomorpha. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every
            continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a
            wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet.
            With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or
            bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily lifeâ€”as food,
            clothing, a companion, and as a source of artistic inspiration.

          <h3>Terminology</h3>
          <p>
            Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does. An older
            term for an adult rabbit is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin
            cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.
            Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often
            applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally,
            especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has
            been used to refer to a young rabbit.

          <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia
            (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order,
            Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). Below are some of the genera
            and species of the rabbit.

            <h3>Differences from hares</h3>
            <p>
              Hares are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair
              and good vision, while rabbits are altricial, born hairless and
              blind, and requiring closer care. Hares (and cottontail rabbits)
              live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground,
              while most rabbits live in social groups in burrows or warrens.
              Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more
              elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer. Hares
              have not been domesticated, while descendants of the European
              rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.

            <h3>Domestication</h3>
            <p>
              Rabbits have long been domesticated. Beginning in the Middle Ages,
              the European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in
              ancient Rome. Selective breeding has generated a wide variety of
              rabbit breeds, many of which (since the early 19th century) are
              also kept as pets. Some strains of rabbit have been bred
              specifically as research subjects. As livestock, rabbits are bred
              for their meat and fur.

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate
              except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather.
              Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This
              way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are
              often confused. Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and
              rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the
              scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a
              result of convergent evolution.

            <h3>Hind limb elements</h3>
            <p>
              The anatomy of rabbits hind limbs are structurally similar to that
              of other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of
              locomotion. The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the
              femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the
              tarsals). These bones are created through endochondral
              ossification during development. Like most land mammals, the round
              head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae.

            <h3>Musculature</h3>
            <p>
              Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force,
              maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main
              parts; foot, thigh, and leg. The hind limbs of a rabbit are an
              exaggerated feature, that are much longer than the forelimbs
              providing more force. Rabbits run on their toes to gain the
              optimal stride during locomotion. The force put out by the hind
              limbs is contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion
              tibia and fibula, and muscular features.

            <h3>Ears</h3>
            <p>
              Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and
              avoid predators. In the family leporidae, the ears are typically
              longer than they are wide. For example, in black tailed jack
              rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to
              their body size that allow them to detect predators from far away.

            <h3>Respiratory system</h3>
            <p>
              The rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the
              two compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate. The
              nasal cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a
              cartilage barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust
              before it can enter the respiratory tract.

            <h3>Digestion</h3>
            <p>
              Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and
              leafy weeds. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of
              cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem via
              a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of
              feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter
              of which are known as caecotrophs or "night droppings" and are
              immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). Rabbits
              reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do
              cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further
              and extract sufficient nutrients.

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>
              Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural
              inclination is toward nocturnal activity. In 2011, the average
              sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours
              per day. As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with
              their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit
              to respond to potential danger.
